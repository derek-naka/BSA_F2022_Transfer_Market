# BSA_F22_Transfer_Market

Using data sourced from tranferus.net to determine to what extent does money run the Premiere League.  We are focusing on the amount of money spent in the transfer season of the Premiere League and determining if there is a direct correlation between money spent and success.  We are looking at both the long term and short term affects of the money spent on the transfer market.  In terms of long term, we look at the total money spent over the course of 10 years.  In terms of short term, we are looking at which season (the season of, the next season, or in 2 seasons) does the money have the most impact since it might take players time to adjust to new teams.
